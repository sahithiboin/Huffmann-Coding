 ******OPTION 1******

Huffman Encoding and Decoding In java :

1) Works perfectly with txt files.
2) The file is compressed in very less time. At maximum of 10secs.
4) Works with pdf, docx,and images in terms with compression of files but files not restored properly.
5) Tested on AFS machine.

For Huffman Encoding:
Compile instruction: javac filename.java
Execution instruction: java filename file(to be encoded).txt

Example:
Compile instruction: javac henc3821.java
Execution instruction: java henc3821 sampletext.txt

For Huffman Decoding:
Execution instruction: java filename file(to be decoded).txt

Example:
Execution instruction: java hdec3821 sampletext.txt

 ******OPTION 2******

PageRank and HITS Algorithm is implemented and no problem was observed. 

For HITS Algorithm:
Compile instruction: javac filename.java
Execution instruction: java filename iterations initialvalue file.txt

Example:
Compile instruction: javac hits3821.java
Execution instruction: java hits3821 15 -1 samplegraph.txt

For PageRank Algorithm:
Compile instruction: javac filename.java
Execution instruction: java filename iterations initialvalue file.txt

Example:
Compile instruction: javac pgrk3821.java
Execution instruction: java pgrk3821 15 -1 samplegraph.txt
